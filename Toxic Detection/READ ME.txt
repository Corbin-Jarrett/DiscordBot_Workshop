What is Toxic Detection Bot?

- Uses the on_message function to read chat messages
- If a user says a word that is listed in negative_words.txt or positive_words.txt, the user will earn/lose reputation points
- Negative words will increase a player's toxicness level (variable).
	- If the toxicness level reaches a certain number, then the user will be banned
- Positive words will increase a player's kindness level (variable).
	- If the kindness level reaches a a certain number, then the toxicness level will be reduced


BONUS EXCERCISE:
- Create a command function called "profile" with parameters "ctx" and "victim: discord.User = None"
- When the command "profile" is called, the bot will output the users "Reputation", "Kindness", and "Toxicness"
- When the command "profile" is called with a user mention (e.g. <prefix> profile @user), the mentioned user will have their "Reputation", "Kindness", and "Toxicness" outputed
- Command must ignore bots

BONUS EXERCISE 2:
- Redo the first bonus, but this time, use embeded messages to output the user's stats
